# Text Generator LSTM

The Text Generator LSTM is a Python script that uses Keras' LSTM to train and generate new text based on the style of the provided reference texts.

## About

The main objective of this project was to study text generation and experiment with developing a simple script that generates lyric ideas based on references in training. However, it is not limited to just lyrics, as it can also be used for other types of text. Moreover, the project aimed to design a "user-friendly" script that efficiently produces text files based on specified parameters through terminal commands. 

In addition, the script provides the flexibility to select custom parameters such as genre (if an info.json file is included in the folder) or artist/text (based on the folder name) for training. This is accomplished through scanning the folders and utilizing JSON objects.
